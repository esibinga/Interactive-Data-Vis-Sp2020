      How do I interpret the "Change" number? 
      <br><br>
      "Unusually hot" means temperatures hotter 
      than the 95th percentile temperatures at that location from 1948-2015. 
      A change of 32.14 means that there are now about 32 more days per year in that
      location that are hotter than 5% of hottest days from 1948-2015. A change of 
      -16.18 means that the location is seeing about 16 fewer days per year that 
      reach the historic 5% hottest mark.
